a_x, a_y, a_z are accelerometer data and are measured in g's, where a total magnitude of 0 is freefall, and 1 is seen while sitting still

g_x, g_y, g_z are gyroscope data and measured in degrees per second, often times read up to +/- 20 dps while not rotationg

m_x, m_y, m_z are magnetometer data, measured in gauses

agl is the elevation above ground level, in meters

delta is the time in seconds since the last data point

lat and long are latitude an longitude in decimal degrees format

temp is temperature in degrees C, don't trust this one much

time is a python structure, of date and time, not super useful. use delta instead

gps_time is the time the gps reports, in utc
